	Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy in the adult population. Though CTS is a frequent diagnostic outcome, the pathologies that manifest as CTS remain obscure.  If a diagnosis is not specific to etiology, disease processes can be missed and appropriate treatment delayed.  CTS is most frequently attributed to median nerve impingement from overuse such as typing, playing an instrument, or handiwork.  Overuse is a prevailing factor, but there are numerous other risk factors and etiologies that can predispose patients to CTS.  These underlying etiologies are of clinical importance in order to best treat and cure specific organic diseases and congenital anomalies. This is website is designed to be a tool for diagnosing CTS as well as a center for information on CTS.
